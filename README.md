A fork from https://github.com/dnish/meteor-framework7 to learn how to make framework7 work on Meteor

# Changes from parent branch

- Added as many working example as possible

- switched to [flow-router](https://atmospherejs.com/kadira/flow-router) and [mcissel:flow-transition](https://atmospherejs.com/mcissel/flow-transition) (Thanks to [TomFreudenberg](https://github.com/TomFreudenberg)). 

# TODO

- Make Flow Transition work
- Get F7 smart-select to render in next page instead of just in-view popup/picker
