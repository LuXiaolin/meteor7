# Meteor+Framework7+FlowRouter Demo

## Live Demo: 

- https://meteor7.meteor.com/ (flow-router. Dynamic load content load issue, e.g. Google Map, Swiper)
- https://meteor7-iron.meteor.com/ (iron:router. Better consistency)

## Changes from parent branch

- Added as many working example as possible

- switched to [flow-router](https://atmospherejs.com/kadira/flow-router) (Thanks to [TomFreudenberg](https://github.com/TomFreudenberg))
- transition works with [philippspo:momentum-flow-router] (https://atmospherejs.com/philippspo/momentum-flow-router). Example: Menu -> Contacts -> Contact Detail

## Known issues

- momentum-flow-router caused swiper & google map not to render on default 'fade' transition.

## TODO

- Get F7 smart-select to render in next page instead of just in-view popup/picker
